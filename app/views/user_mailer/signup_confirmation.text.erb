Hi <%= @user.name %>,

I just created an account for you in the QA web app! Now you can receive quality email alerts relevant to you and your department.

Here's the link to the app: http://skfoodgroup.herokuapp.com

and here are your login credentials:

username: <%= @user.email %>
password: password

(don't forget to reset your password under settings at the top right!)

Just how much you interact with this application is up to you; if you're interested, take a look around!

Thanks,
--
